    "# Proposal: Effect of French government regulations on national air traffic \n",

    "# 1. Context and research questions\n",
    "In 2023, the French government stopped domestic flights for routes that can be reached in 2 hours 30 or less by alternative methods (trains). This only includes flights between Paris - Lyon / Bordeaux / Nantes. However, it should have included flights like Lyon-Marseille, which offers a train journey of only 1:40 hours. In this report, we will explore the effects of the partial flight ban in terms of CO2 emissions, as well as the shift in passengers between destinations. Furthermore, it will be explored if this ban can be implemented in other major EU countries like Germany. This leads to the following research question, which is supported by its sub-questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RQ:** To what extent did the French decree of May 2023 reduce domestic aviation compared to Germany?\n",
    "Based on data from Eurostat, using python to visualise the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-RQs:**\n",
    "What is the effect on emissions related to aviation in France?\n",
    "What is the effect on passenger numbers at affected airports on the French national level?\n",
    "What could be the effect of this kind of regulation in another European country, especially focusing on Germany? \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Time scale and spatial/geographical scale\n",
    "The time scale is from the first quartile of 1993 until the first quartile of 2024, due to availability of Eurostat data. The spatial scale is continental France for all the research questions, and, in addition, Germany for the third sub-question.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Data sources\n",
    "The data used is a mix of French and European sources, which will provide background information on the regulation, numbers about national aviation by countries and by airports, as well as air traffic in France since the 1980s. Data about emissions are gathered based on emissions per individual passenger in both France and Germany. The sources are listed below:\n",
